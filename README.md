# LETS INTRODUCE OOP IN PYTHON
### DO YOU KNOW WHAT OOP IS?
Object Orientation is a programming philosophy that has revolutionized the way developers write software. Its architecture is based on objects, which represent real-world entities with specific properties and behaviors.
### BUT BEFORE STUDYING THIS SOME LITTLE TIPS
1. **LEARN THE BASIC SYNTAX OF PYTHON**
Before you start learning OOP, it's important to know the basic syntax of Python. In particular, you must understand flow control structures, variables, functions, and classes.
2. **KNOW THE BASIC PRINCIPLES OF OOP**
It's important to have an understanding of the basic principles of OOP, such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism. These concepts will help you understand how classes and objects work in Python.
3. **GET FAMILIAR WITH CLASSES IN PYTHON**
Classes are the foundation of OOP in Python. You need to learn how to define a class and how to use class attributes and methods.
4. **PRACTICE A LOT**
Practice is the most fundamental thing to acquire programming skills. Try writing your Python code using classes and objects.
5. **READ DOCUMENTATION AND FOLLOW TUTORIALS**
There are many resources available online to help you learn OOP in Python. Read official documentation and tutorials to better understand OOP concepts (I recommend [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/python/) for getting started).
6. **WORK ON REAL PROJECTS**
Once you have a good basic understanding of OOP in Python, try working on real projects to put your skills into practice. This will help you consolidate your knowledge and gain practical experience.
